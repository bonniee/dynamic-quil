# dynamic-quil

A Leiningen template for creating a REPL-friendly graphics programming project using Quil.

## Usage

`lein new dynamic-quil myproject`

Then, edit `dynamic.clj` to see your project come to life.

This is a pretty simple template; it just handles setting up some boilerplate for Quil, and includes auto-reloading within the `draw` function.

For more info on Quil, see the docs at [quil.info](http://quil.info/).
